Data Manipulation & Security Shield Toolbox
🚀 Overview
A professional-grade Python project demonstrating core Data Engineering and Cybersecurity skills. This repository focuses on building secure data pipelines, implementing data sanitization, and generating synthetic datasets for analysis.
The project incorporates industry standards learned from ISC² (Certified in Cybersecurity) and Google Cloud Security frameworks.
🛡️ Key Features
 * Data Sanitization Core: Implementation of a robust security layer to mask PII (Personally Identifiable Information) using Regular Expressions (Regex).
 * Security-First Approach: Automated removal of sensitive infrastructure data (passwords, SSNs, API keys) during the ETL process.
 * Professional Logging: Integrated Python logging module for audit trails and error tracking, essential for enterprise-level applications.
 * Synthetic Data Generation: Creating large-scale, realistic datasets using NumPy and Pandas for testing and modeling.
🛠️ Technologies Used
 * Languages: Python 3.x
 * Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Re (Regular Expressions), Logging
 * Methodology: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
 * Concepts: Data Privacy (GDPR-aligned), Data Anonymization, Secure Pipeline Design.
🔧 How to Run
